# Is the Transformer architecture suitable for chess?

The Transformer architecture has demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to encode human language and knowledge. It effectively generates heuristics to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens, based on the context of the sentence. These heuristics can be tuned to respond to various strategies, such as text completion, agent, or assistant.

These properties make the Transformer architecture an intriguing tool for a chess engine. In fact, the approach used in other engines like AlphaZero is built around a heuristic engine that helps reduce the vast number of possible moves in complex games like chess.

The Transformer architecture can be adapted to predict the next best move in a chess game, given the current state of the board and the sequence of previous moves. By training the model on a large dataset of chess games, it can learn to recognize patterns and strategies that lead to successful outcomes.
